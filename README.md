The IPL Game Win Predictor is a data-driven project that accurately predicts the winning percentage of two teams playing against 
each other in an IPL cricket match. It utilizes data pipelines, logistic regression, and machine learning techniques to generate 
reliable predictions based on inputs such as runs, overs, and wickets of the chasing team.

Features:-

Accurate Prediction: The IPL Game Win Predictor employs logistic regression, a popular machine learning algorithm, to generate 
accurate predictions of the winning percentage for two competing teams.

User-friendly Interface: The project incorporates a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to input relevant
match data and receive real-time predictions.

Data Pipelines: The project utilizes data pipelines to process and transform the input data, ensuring efficient and accurate 
prediction generation.

Pickle Library Integration: The project utilizes the pickle library to save and load the trained logistic regression model, 
enabling quick and seamless prediction generation.
